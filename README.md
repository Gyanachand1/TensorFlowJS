##### 	Demos Created using TensorFlow.JS    #####


Facemesh-Camera.html :	Real-time Face Tracking using TensorFlow.js

			Takes live video stream from webcam and creates facemesh
			(facial feature-map) by capturing 468 facial landmark points

			Install npm package dependencies as described here:
			https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow-models/facemesh

Facemesh-Video.html :   

			The script is exactly same as Facemesh-Camera.html except
			it takes .mp4 video as input instead of live camera stream.

			Sample video file to try: jim-carrey-slow.mp4

			The video is intentionally run in slow-motion to capture 
			facial expressions clearly from each frame..


Body-Segment.html   :

			Body Segmentation using TensorFlow.JS Body-Pix model

			Takes live video stream from web camera, and runs
			segmentation using Body-Pix model from TensorFlow.JS

			Link to TensorFlow.JS Body-Pix model :

			https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/body-pix

More scripts coming soon..
